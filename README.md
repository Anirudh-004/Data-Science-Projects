Sales Analysis using python pandas

Setup:

•	First choose the option "Download ZIP" from the green download button. Then, extract all of the files to the location where you'll be editing your code.

•	Install Jupyter Notebook: https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

•	Install Pandas Library: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html

Explanation: 

In this project, I have used Python Pandas and Python Matplotlib in-order to get the insights to analyze and answer business related questions related to the sales data. The data consists thousands of electronic store purchases which is classified based on the month, type of the product and its cost, etc. 


Data Pre-Processing: 

•	First I have removed NaN values from the Dataframe.

•	Changing the type of the columns(to numeric and vice versa).


Exploratory Data Analysis: Analysis of business related questions.

•	What is the best month for the sales? How much was the money earned for that particular month?

•	Which city sold the highest number of products?

•	What is the best time to display in-order to maximize the likelihood of customer’s buying products ?

•	Which of the products were ordered the most?

In-order to answer these questions I have used different pandas and matplotlib methods such as concatenating the multiple csv files to create a new dataframe , incorporating groupby to carry out aggregate analysis. Plotting bar graphs and line graphs to visualize the results.
